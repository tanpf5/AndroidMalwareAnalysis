# AndroidMalwareAnalysis
As the explosive growing of information, smart phone is necessary part of our daily life. At the same time, a varity of malwares become more and more. It's very difficult to figure them out among the massive mobile application. Malwares are very dangerous and may lead to different degrees of harm.
There're two ways to detect malware: dynamic analysis and static analysis
I adopt the static analysis because of its low protential risk and high safty.
The program can read a apk file and decompile it. Then the program analyze different kinds of api automatically and send dozens of protential risk paramaters to the learning machine.
Before I already give several examples to learning machine for learning, and it produces a knowledge base. Then we use the paramaters from the static part to judge the safty degree of this application.
